This template will create a Virtual Network, a subnet for the network, a Virtual Network Gateway and a Connection to your network outside of Azure (defined as your `local` network). This could be anything such as your on-premises network and can even be used with other cloud networks such as [AWS Virtual Private Cloud](https://github.com/sedouard/aws-vpc-to-azure-vnet). It also provisions an Ubuntu instance attached to the Azure Virtual Network so that you can test connectivity.

Please note that you must have a Public IP for your other network's VPN gateway and cannot be behind an NAT.

Although only the parameters in [azuredeploy.parameters.json](./azuredeploy.parameters.json) are necessary, you can override the defaults of any of the template parameters.
